## Building

### Windows

Visual Studio 2010 and the Platform SDK is required for building on Windows.
Other dependencies are included in the repo.

Check out the git repo and generate the Visual Studio projects:

    git clone https://github.com/benvanik/npvr.git
    cd npvr
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    run-gyp.bat

Open `build\npvr\npvr.sln` and build. The outputs will be placed into
`build\npvr\Debug\`.

Copy the following files into `Debug\`:
* `manifest.json`
* `third_party\sixense\bin\win32\release_dll\sixense.dll`

Uninstall any previous installation before continuing.

#### Installing in Firefox

Open an administrator command prompt and cd to the `Debug\` directory.

    regsvr32 npvr.dll

You'll only need to do this once.

#### Installing in Chrome

Open `chrome://extensions`, choose 'Load unpacked extension', and select the
`Debug\` folder.

### Debugging

Make sure to uninstall the pre-built binary and instead install the plugin
from the Debug build directory. When trying to rebuild the plugin always ensure
the browsers that have loaded it are closed.

#### Chrome

Install the Chrome Canary. Running it on its own (instead of your main Chrome
instance) makes it much easier to debug/restart/etc.

Exit all previous instances and launch from a command prompt:

    "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\chrome.exe" --debug-plugin-loading --enable-logging --v=1 --plugin-startup-dialog

Open a page with the plugin and wait for the popup telling you the process ID.
Switch to Visual Studio, go Debug -> Attach to Process, select the Google plugin
process with the matching process ID, and attach.

#### Firefox

Try to run Firefox with no other pages loaded.

Disable the out-of-process plugins to make things easier: open about:config,
find `dom.ipc.plugins.enabled`, and set it to false. Restart Firefox.

Launch, open the page, and attach to firefox.exe in Visual Studio.
