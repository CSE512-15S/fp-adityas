    Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.
    <br>
    <br>
    We've collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid
    mass and composition from multiple scientific sources. With this information,
    we estimate the costs and rewards of mining asteroids.
    <br>
    <br>
    Details on orbits and basic physical parameters are sourced from the Minor
    Planet Center and NASA JPL. Composition data is based on spectral
    classification and size. Our calculations incorporate conclusions from
    multiple scientific publications in addition to cross-referencing known
    meteorite data.
