A pipeline is a series of steps executed in order, usually via cron or some
other regular trigger.

- Pipeline steps are in the run/ directory.  They are executed in order, hence
the naming convention of ##_foo, where ## indicates priority (lower is better).
- Every step is a folder that contains a run.sh.  Each run.sh is called once
each time the pipeline runs.

Sample invocation:

  ./pipeline

Sample invocation of a single step:

  ./pipline 00_foo

It matches patterns (same as above):

  ./pipline 00_
