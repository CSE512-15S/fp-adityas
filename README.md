# Immersive Data Visualization with Virtual Reality

## Abstract
There has been a resurgence of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) with the advent of several consumer-ready head mounted displays. And while VR has a long standing tradition in graphics literature traceable to the early 90's, little research has been conducted on the implications of modern VR and 3D displays on Data Visualization. In this work we explore how to create immersive 3D data visualizations and subsequently interact with them effectively using novel modalities such as head pose. We hypothesize that an immersive data visualization experience provides benefits beyond traditional desktop counterparts and that a user is better connected to the data, both perceptually and emotionally.

## Team Members
- Aditya Sankar (adityas@uw) - Design and development of Unity and WebGL applications

## Running Instructions
Correctly running these visualizations requires Oculus Rift DK2 hardware. They may run without the hardware attached, but an immersive interactive experience will not be possible. 

* Unity Demo: Download and run UnityVR/brushing_demo.exe
* [AsterankVR](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aditya/files/misc/fp-adityas/asterankVR)
* [NeuralNetworkVR](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aditya/files/misc/fp-adityas/NeuralNetworkVR)

## Development Process
Wrangling the experimental drivers, pre-release SDK and finicky hardware were by far the most challenging part of this project. Since VR is a newly emerging platform, a lot of the tools are not yet mature. But I felt like that's a fair price to pay in order to be able to experiment with such ground breaking technology. Fortunately, due to it's popularity, there are also a lot of open source projects related to VR and several forum posts and troubleshooting guides available online.

This project builds upon the following amazing open-source projects:

* [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js/)
* [Asterank](https://github.com/typpo/asterank)
* [Neural Network](https://github.com/nxxcxx/Neural-Network)
