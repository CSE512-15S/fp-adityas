# Immersive Data Visualization with Virtual Reality

## Abstract
There has been a resurgence of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) with the advent of several consumer-ready head mounted displays. And while VR has a long standing tradition in graphics literature traceable to the early 90's, little research has been done on the implications of modern VR and 3D displays on Data Visualization. In this work we explore how to create immersive 3D data visualizations and subsequently interact with them effectively using novel modalities such as gaze and touch. We hypothesize that an immersive data visualization experience provides benefits beyond traditional desktop counterparts and that a user is better connected to the data, both perceptually and emotionally.
